*** Launching on a Cluster
**** Description
The Spark cluster mode overview explains the key concepts in running on a cluster. Spark can run both by itself, or over several existing cluster managers. It currently provides several options for deployment:

Amazon EC2: our EC2 scripts let you launch a cluster in about 5 minutes
Standalone Deploy Mode: simplest way to deploy Spark on a private cluster
Apache Mesos
Hadoop YARN

** DONE What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) forms a central part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), by allowing users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.


* Docker  
Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

* Google Cloud Platform
  
* Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open source container cluster manager. It schedules any number of container replicas across a group of node instances. A master instance exposes the Kubernetes API, through which tasks are defined. Kubernetes spawns containers on nodes to handle the defined tasks.

The number and type of containers can be dynamically modified according to need. An agent (a kubelet) on each node instance monitors containers and restarts them if necessary.

Kubernetes is optimized for Google Cloud Platform, but can run on any physical or virtual machine.

To get started, visit the Kubernetes home page.

** Store Files
*** gsutil cp -r /sample-files gs://interactive-tutorial-xrq86s-bucket [/]
**** What does gsutil do?
**** Why do we pass cp to gsutil as an argument?
**** What does gs:// mean? Seems releated to a bucket.
