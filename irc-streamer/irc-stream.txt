##javascript :--: Potasmic :--: You have a Node package for that?
##javascript :--: _3by8 :--: I'm going to grab some food.
#emacs :--: twb :--: technomancy: well *I* do it
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: _3by8, Anytime you need some help though, look it up or get on an IRC channel. Really helpful stuff
#Node.js :--: buddyp450 :--: Having difficulty understanding my CORS issue... attempting to leverage a publicly available JSON api but doing an http.get request on the resource doesn't pass preflight access control checks?
#haskell :--: nitrix :--: bottl: It works on type classes too, `:i Foldable`, if you're curious.
#Node.js :--: buddyp450 :--: I'm confused why I don't just get the raw content back as I would from doing the GET request in postman or some other fiddling tool.
#haskell :--: nitrix :--: It even gives a list of instances at the bottom.
#haskell :--: bottl :--: right,i have tried it under ghci
#emacs :--: twb :--: "The use of the prefix "grand-" dates from the early 13th century, from the Anglo-French graund. The term was used as a translation of Latin magnus.^[9]"
#haskell :--: bottl :--: very cool
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: tcsc, Honestly, the biggest reason why I'm reading it is because I wanna get into a cool company for an internship next year
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: tcsc, And interviews are pretty much algorithms, I've heard
#emacs :--: twb :--: In Old English, you'd just say "sixth father" instead of "great great great great grandfather"
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: no clue. never did internships
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: never had straight algorithm questions for interviews but i have heard of them
#emacs :--: technomancy :--: that's way better; we should bring that back
#emacs :--: twb :--: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grannygate
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: hm yeah
#haskell :--: hjulle :--: It actually works on any definition. `:i fold` will show that it is defined as part of the typeclass Foldable.
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: google and facebook and stuff
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: Actually those two are the goal
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: I'd be really pleased with myself if I could pull one off
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: But most likely not haha
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: i work at mozilla now and they just asked me to implement things. no specific algorithms.
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: mozilla has paid workers?
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: tons
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: i'd hope its the same for other big tech companies
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: oh haha
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: I thought they were all open source
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: they are
#emacs :--: e1f_ :--: Looks like the Miami herald was one of the news papers who worked on the leaks. It's reporting people who bought condos via offshore companies
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: Then I guess I don't know what open source is
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: it doesn't sound like you do
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: :p
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: haha
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: enlighten me?
#emacs :--: twb :--: capitalists gonna capital
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: the source is available. it doesn't mean they can't make money off of it
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: Hm.
#emacs :--: bpalmer :--: I want an offshore condo. Preferably on the back of a giant turtle.
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: How do they do that?
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: mozilla makes a lot of money based on what search engine they put as default, for exmaple
#emacs :--: mrm :--: twb: It'd be hard to discuss having two fathers in old english I suppose.
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: "they" being computer owners?
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: they being mozilla
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: ohhh lol
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: I thought you said browser
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: or the author of the open source software
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: yeah
#emacs :--: e1f_ :--: http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article69248462.html
#emacs :--: rudybot :--: http://teensy.info/zaCLdW0FD1
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: that makes sense now haha
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: that'd be the only reason Bing is still used
#emacs :--: twb :--: bpalmer: why not terrapin
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: yahoo is the default search engine for firefox but same thing
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: Yep, same thing
#haskell :--: nitrix :--: hjulle: Thanks for the corrections. It is way past bedtime here :P
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: Do they have like developers on salary, though?
#emacs :--: twb :--: then you could be like baba yaga
#haskell :--: nitrix :--: 'night.
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: mozilla? yes, over a thousand of them
#emacs :--: e1f_ :--: 'And experts say a lack of controls on cash real-estate deals has made Miami a magnet for questionable currency.'
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: Ah
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: or, idk how many are developers vs other employees
#emacs :--: twb :--: All of florida is a write-off
#emacs :--: bpalmer :--: I fear a terrapin with chicken legs would be quite disturbing.
##javascript :--: systemfault :--: Isn't Yahoo... Bing as far as search engine goes?
##javascript :--: jaziz :--: For some reason, I thought it was just some giant charity project where a bunch of people decided to create something cool haha
#haskell :--: hjulle :--: Well, it's way past bedtime for me too. Or rather, it's almost morning here.
#emacs :--: twb :--: I hear that florida is basically just full of gun-crazy reactionary old people who shoot hookers on their front lawn
#emacs :--: mrm :--: Hey!
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: jaziz: it's weird. there's a non profit that owns a for profit company and the for profit company gives most of the money back to the non profit
#emacs :--: mrm :--: There's also Disneyland.
#emacs :--: e1f_ :--: The costal regions will be flooded in 20-50 years. 
#emacs :--: twb :--: pretty sure walt disney qualifies
#emacs :--: bpalmer :--: Disneyworld.
#emacs :--: bpalmer :--: Disneyland is safely stored in California.
#emacs :--: mrm :--: Right, one of those things.
#emacs :--: bpalmer :--: (where nothing scandalous happens)
#emacs :--: twb :--: "Are all the jews dead yet?" "No" "Freeze me for another 100 years!"
##javascript :--: tcsc :--: but any open souce that is, well, a large enough deal definitely has salaried developers.
#emacs :--: netkam2 :--: osx rice
##javascript :--: jinmugenfu :--: yes
#emacs :--: riceandbeans :--: offby1: where did you immigrate from?
#emacs :--: twb :--: riceandbeans: philis, obviously
#Node.js :--: FuzzySockets :--: What is the best way to sanitize user submitted request data in node.js?
#emacs :--: twb :--: "the land of the Philistines as a pentapolis in southwestern Levant comprising the five city-states of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, from Wadi Gaza in the south to the Yarqon River in the north."
#emacs :--: twb :--: Incidentally I've been reading about dhimmis in al-Andalus and even if you paid your jizya, it seems like if the caliph at the time was an asshole, you still had a shitty time.
